Objective
Create a web application which allows users to manage your favourite recipes.
Create API’s to show all available recipes and the actions to create, update and delete a recipe.
API’s could be able to retrieve recipes with following attributes:
1. Date and time of creation (formatted as dd‐MM‐yyyy HH:mm).
2. Indicator if the dish is vegetarian.
3. Indicator displaying the number of people the dish is suitable for.
4. Display ingredients as a list.
5. Cooking instructions.
Requirements
Please ensure that we have some documentation about the architectural choices and also how to run the application.
The project is expected to be delivered as a GitHub repository URL or a zip file.
All these requirements needs to be satisfied:
1. Application must be production ready.
2. REST application must be implemented using Java.
3. Data must be persisted in a database.
4. Use any frameworks of your choice for REST.
5. Unit testing must be taken in due consideration.
6. Describe at least 10 testing scenarios using GivenWhenThen style.
7. The API's must be built ensuring that it is secured from security attacks.
Bonus
1. REST application should be secured by implementing authentication process (please provide credentials).
2. Application should have an API documentation.
3. Write automation tests for the described testing scenarios.
4. Use of container based solutions is an added advantage.
5. Creating a single-page application illustrating the use of API.
